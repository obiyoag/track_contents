## Motivation
{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="/assets/img/myops.png" class="img-fluid" zoomable=true caption="Figure 1. Fully supervised and weakly supervised myocardial pathology segmentation." %}


Myocardial infarction is a common and serious cardiovascular disease that leads to necrosis and scar formation in cardiac tissues, significantly impacting patients' quality of life and health. Utilizing cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging techniques, particularly the late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) sequence, allows for the visualization of infarcted scar regions within the myocardium. However, manual segmentation of infarcted scars from LGE images is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task, while automated segmentation methods can enhance efficiency and reduce human error. 

As shown in Figure 1, traditional fully supervised deep learning methods require a large amount of accurately labeled data for training, which is often challenging and expensive. Weakly supervised learning methods, which aim to train models with limited supervision, have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. By utilizing only **partial** or **noisy** labels, weakly supervised methods enable the training of deep learning models with reduced reliance on expensive and labor-intensive annotation efforts. 



<!-- 
Myocardial infarction (MI) is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide. Assessment of myocardial viability is essential in the diagnosis and treatment management of MI patients <d-cite key="myops1"></d-cite>. Multi-sequence cardiac magnetic resonance (MS-CMR) images can provide valuable myocardial pathology information, which is important for the diagnosis and treatment management of patients. As shown in Figure 1 (A), balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) cine sequences present clear anatomical boundaries, while late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2-weighted (T2) CMR sequences visualize myocardial scar and edema of MI, respectively.

## Task

Through this challenge, we aim to encourage participants to explore and develop novel weakly supervised deep learning methods for accurate segmentation of myocardial infarcted scars from LGE images with limited supervision. Additionally, we encourage participants to tackle the challenge of incorporating multi-center data, recognizing the importance of addressing real-world complexities to enhance the robustness and applicability of their proposed solutions. The best works, following the precedent of [MyoPS 2020](https://zmiclab.github.io/zxh/0/myops20/), will be recognized with awards.

<!-- 
The target of this track is to segment myocardial pathology regions, specifically scar and edema, from multi-sequence CMR data. This track seeks innovative solutions to address MyoPS using real-world multi-sequence CMR data. We encourage participants to overcome challenges such as the inclusion of multi-center data, missing sequences for some centers <d-cite key="myops2"></d-cite>, and misalignments in multi-sequence CMRs <d-cite key="myops3"></d-cite>, as illustrated in Figure 1 (B).-->

 <!--Works are evaluated based on several key criteria: **Test Results**, **Novelty of Methodologies** and **Quality of the Manuscript**.-->

<!-- The selected papers will be published in our proceedings [see previous proceedings](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-65651-5).-->

## Data

This challenge will provide LGE for 300 patients across 6 centers from China, France, and the United Kingdom. Traced with lines in LGE to indicate scarred areas.

### Data Split

The dataset is divided into three main parts: training, validation, and test sets:

- **Validation Set**: 50 LGE from Center A.
- **Test Set**: 50 LGE from Center A.
- **Training Set**: The rest LGE from Centers A, B, C, D, E, and F.



### Data Format
LGE and line label of scars will be provided in the NIfTI format as follows:
- [Patient Identifier]_LGE.nii.gz
- [Patient Identifier]_line.nii.gz


## Metrics

The performance of scar and edema segmentation results will be evaluated byï¼š
- **Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)**
- **Accuracy (ACC)**
- **Sensitivity (SEN)**

Note that the track will provide an open platform for research groups to [validate](http://zmic.org.cn/) and [test](http://zmic.org.cn/) their methods. For a fair comparison, the test dataset will remain unseen. Participants need to submit their [docker container](http://zmic.org.cn/) to our platform for testing.

<!-- 
### Ranking

The best work, following the precedent of [MyoPS 2020](https://zmiclab.github.io/zxh/0/myops20/), will be recognized with awards. A work is assessed based on several key criteria:**Test Results**, **Ggeneralizability of Methodologies** and **Quality of the Manuscript**.

- **Test Results**: The performance of the methods as demonstrated by the test outcomes.
- **Novelty of Methodologies**: The originality and **generalizability** in the proposed methods.
- **Quality of the Manuscript**: The clarity, organization, and correctness of the written submission. The selected papers will be published in our proceedings [see previous proceedings](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-65651-5). 
- **Presentation of Their Paper**: The effectiveness of the oral or poster presentation in conveying the work.

## Rules
- **Only automatic methods are acceptable.** Participants must utilize algorithms that do not require manual intervention or human-assisted processes for the segmentation task.
- **External data sets and pre-trained models are not allowed in this track.** The solutions must be developed using only the data provided within the scope of this track and cannot leverage any external datasets or models for assistance.


## Registration
Please [**sign up**](http://zmic.org.cn/acait_2024/weak_myops/) to join this track.

## Submission Guidance

### Model Submission
After registration, we will assign participants an account to log into our [evaluation platform](http://zmic.org.cn/). Participants can directly upload their predictions on the validation data (in NIfTI format) via the website.
